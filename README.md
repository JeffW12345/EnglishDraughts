ENGLISH DRAUGHTS

This is a two player draughts game played on the same localhost that I completed for my Advanced Programming course as part of my MSc in Software Development.

To run, type: 

javac *.java

java Server

java Client

'java Client' needs to be typed in two different terminals.

NB: The code currently does not run properly on Macs, but I am in the process of fixing that issue.
